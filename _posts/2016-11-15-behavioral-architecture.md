We think we make completely logical choices. But actually, we are emotional humans, we're not completely logical all the time. We're... biased.

- **Confirmation bias**: we tend to search for stuff to confirm our beliefs. Google doesn't help with that cause it will show you results based on your bias.

- **Endowment bias**: we place more value for things we own. `Your stuff > Other stuff`

- **Availibility bias**: If you can think of an example quickly, then it is the most important one for you. Ease of recall is equivalent to importance. Deer Vs Shark, who is most dangerous? We directly think of the Shark ofc. 
`Micro services == Awesome`, `Spring > Java EE`, `Serverless > Docker > VM > Bare Metal`
