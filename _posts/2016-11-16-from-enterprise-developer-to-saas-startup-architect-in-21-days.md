## TL;DR

- In Enterprise world you focus on few parts of the whole architect whreas in startup world, you have to deal with the whole stack, and that is hard.
- Start like a project, Act as a company
- Lean canvas software plan is a cool tool to use to explain your business

## Full Version

Being an enterprise archtect (small scope) is so much different than startup archtiect (taking care of full stack). Being good at a few thing Vs having to deal with everything. 

Trust yourself but take a ladder, take the tools, mentors. Don't blindly jump into startup world.

Start like a project, Act as a company

Experiment (+Earn) with prototypes. 

In the past as an enterprise developer, didn't have to take care of security, CD etc... it was taken care of by other teams in the big company. In a startup you end up taking care of all these things, which can be very scary. 

Startup leadership can't be outsourced.

Outsource what is not core to the business

Keep experimentation + prototyping coss to a minimum
